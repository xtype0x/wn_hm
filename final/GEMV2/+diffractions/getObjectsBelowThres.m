% GETOBJECTSBELOWTHRES For comm. pair, returns objects within given range
%
% Input:
% 	effectiveDist:          effective distance for communication pair
% 	jointObjects:           joint objects for communication pair
% 	jointDistances:         joint distances for communication pair
%
% Output:
% 	objects:                objects that are within effectiveDist
% 	objectsDist:            joint distance to objects from Tx and Rx
