function [intersectionP] = findIntersectionVector(point1,point2,point3,point4)
% FINDINTERSECTIONVECTOR Computes the intersetion of lines in a plane. Line
% 1 is defined by points point1-point2; Line 2 is defined by points
% point3-point4. Each row in pointX defines a point. 
%
% Output:
%   intersectionP:           intersecting points
